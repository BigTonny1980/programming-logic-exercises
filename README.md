# Introduction

This is a repository of simple programming logic exercises. For now, it contains only a few exercises about conditionals (if/else), but I plan to expand it over time. I will add more problems progressively. By the way, you can check what each exercise proposes at the end of each code. The questions are in JS comments format.

## Status

Currently in progress.

## Note

These codes are purely theoretical. As you browse through the algorithms, you will notice that in most of them, there is no interactivity. In almost all of the JavaScript files, there is not even an HTML file linked to them. This is because I chose to run the JS code through Node.js so that I would not have to depend on a browser all the time.
